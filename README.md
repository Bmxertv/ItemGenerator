# ItemGenerator

With the plugin you can generate items when you create a generator and supply it with energy.

# Installation

Download the plugin from [Github](https://github.com/Bmxertv/ItemGenerator). Now move the `ItemGenerator-RELEASE.jar`
into the plugin's folder of the server and state the server afterwards. As soon as the server is started, a new folder
named `ItemGenerator` will be created in the plugin's folder. In this folder you will find a `config.yml` now you can start to set
up the Plugin.
